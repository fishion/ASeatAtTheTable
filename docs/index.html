    <h2>ASATT - A Seat At The Table</h2>
    <p>Our vision as a community is to change outcomes for our children and support them to thrive not just survive education.
    ASATT is an essential group for children of colour or dual heritage and their families who require someone to listen, support, advise and advocate where necessary. Every child counts and every child must have an equal opportunity to thrive in life.</p>
<details>
        <p>Together and with our lived experiences we have a strong understanding of the difficulties that arise around special educational needs, race, trauma and struggles within systems and aim to create opportunities to aid recovery, support and space to be seen and heard.</p>
      <p>A Seat At The Table - Community, Creativity, Connection</p>
      <p>Founder Liz Soper driven by her and her child's own lived experiences navigating education and SEN systems, started to advocate for other children and families in 2017.  She is a Brighton and Hove Autism champion and has a long history in many aspects of childcare with a special interest in early years and primary education. She has gained training in counselling, and with the PDA society and P.A.S.T (Positive Autism Support Training). She is passionate about learning from actually autistic/neurodivergent advocates and academic professionals in relevant fields. She has organised talks, taken part as a speaker and has collaborated with  many other organisers and support groups including: Venessa Bobb, founder of A2nd voice, Lambeth Autism Group and member of the APPG on Autism, and Dr Muna Abdi from Decolonising Education.  Liz has consulted for Can Can Campaigns on their NEU proposal on the impact of poverty, class structural racism on education, and for Brighton and Hove's Parent Carer Council around neuro-developmental pathways and BME communities.</p>
